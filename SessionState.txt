SessionState = data available for all web pages. Use this one!!!

1. In the Page_Load type the state required below:

if (!IsPostBack)
{
    if (Session["Clicks"] == null)
    {
        Session["Clicks"] = 0;
    }
    TextBox1.Text = Session["Clicks"].ToString();
    }
}

2. In the Button1_Click type the counter to store the ["Clicks"] below:

//here the int variable ClicksCount, stores the Session clicks and increments up 1.
int ClicksCount = (int)Session["Clicks"] + 1;
//here convert int to string and store the session memory in the TextBox1.
TextBox1.Text = ClicksCount.ToString();
//here the session memory gets stored back into the int variable ClicksCount.
Session["Clicks"] = ClicksCount;

3. In the Web.Config file inside the brackets <system.web> add the sessionState mode In Process:

<sessionState mode="InProc" cookieless="false"></sessionState>

//---------------------------------------
If you want it to time out type in:

<configuration>
  <system.web>
    <!-- add in this line below. -->
    <sessionState mode="InProc" cookieless="true" timeout="20"></sessionState>
    <!-- ******* default timeout is 20 minutes, Single User Global Data. **************** -->
    
//---------------------------------------

--- Important!! ---
"Session State Data" is available across all pages but only for a single user, if you use a 
Session State ID. To do this you have to tell the web server NOT to use cookies when storing 
data, then it will create an automatically generated ID Number to store the data in.

To do this simply change the tag: cookieless="true", now it will generate the Unique Session
ID Numbers which you can see in the URL.
The computer knows which user it is because of the unique session id that it gave it.

This session state data is stored on the server, and cleared when the session times out, the
default is 20 minutes and is configurable in the web.config file. 

Type in the <sessionstate> tag the minutes you require the server to timeout and delete the data: timeout="1".
